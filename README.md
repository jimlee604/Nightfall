Nightfall
=========
This is an older version of the game, which was saved in Dropbox. I did not set up an emergency shelters (git) before the great fire (computer crash). And so the more updated version of this game is lost. For now, you can play around with it. 

Cheat codes: Clicking "forest" will generate a sword in your inventory. Clicking "shop" will generate a potion. Unfortunately, when fighting an enemy, you will take damage but not deal any damage. Best of luck, adventurer.
